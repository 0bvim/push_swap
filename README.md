# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

| Instruction | Description |
|:-----------:|-------------|
| sa          | swaps the first and second elements of stack A |
| sb          | swaps the first and second elements of stack B |
| ss          | executes the sa and sb commands simultaneously |
| pa          | removes the first element from stack B and places it on top of stack A |
| pb          | removes the first element from stack A and places it on top of stack B |
| ra          | rotates stack A from top to bottom |
| rb          | rotates stack B from top to bottom |
| rr          | rotates both stacks A and B from top to bottom |
| rra         | rotates stack A from bottom to top |
| rrb         | rotates stack B from bottom to top |
| rrr         | rotates both stacks A and B from bottom to top |

### Discription of mandatory part
In this part we need to sort a list of numbers given in command line.
```bash
$> ./push_swap 5 3 2 1 4 # sorted list 1 2 3 4 5
```
Another example
```bash
$> ./push_swap -100 -145 150 10 5 300 # sorted list -145 -100 5 10 300
```
We need to handle errors too, because our program only works with unique numbers, no letter or special characters.
### Discription of bonus part
We need to create a program called 'checker'. This program check whether the list of istructions generated by the push_swap program actually sort the stack properly.
```bash
$>./checker 3 2 1 0
rra
pb
sa
rra
pa
OK # show 'OK' if list was sorted properly

$>./checker 3 2 1 0
sa
rra
pb
KO # show 'KO' if it's unsorted.

$>./checker 3 2 one 0
Error # when are not only numbers in args.

$>./checker "" 1
Error # when have empty string or invalid args
```
